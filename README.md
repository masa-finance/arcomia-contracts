The `admin` is allowed to set configuration variables in the smart contracts.

* Set `INFURA_API_KEY` to the Infura API key in `.env`, if needed

## Installation and usage

Installing via `npm` package:

```bash
npm i @masa-finance/arcomia-contracts
```

Import in your project:

```typescript
import { ArcomiaOGCommunitySBT, ArcomiaOGCommunitySBT__factory } from "@masa-finance/arcomia-contracts";

const arcomiaOGCommunitySBT: ArcomiaOGCommunitySBT = ArcomiaOGCommunitySBT__factory.connect(
  <address>, // address of the deployed contract
  <provider> // web3 provider
);
console.log(await arcomiaOGCommunitySBT.symbol());
```

## Generation of a new release

From a clean `main` branch you can run the release task bumping the version accordingly based on semantic versioning:

```bash
yarn release
```

The task does the following:

* Bumps the project version in `package.json`
* Creates a Git tag
* Commits and pushes everything
* Creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
* Git tag push will trigger a GitHub Action workflow to do a `npm` release

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. You can add this
environment variable to the `.env` file. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases)
